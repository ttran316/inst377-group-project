                            <p>We are hoping to solve the problem of unprofessionalism in 
                                email of a corporate setting. We hope to have a translator 
                                of sorts that can produce effective terms when talking to 
                                coworkers or upper management.</p>

                            <h3>Importance</h3>
                            <p>Everything you say can determine your position in the company, fired
                                or promoted. When that little bit of unprofessionalism slips through
                                in your talk with coworkers, you might be in their sights for something
                                unfavorable.

                            <p>We have produced a translator, with the help of an external api,
                                that could turn your simple words into professional jargon. 
                                Anyone you speak to will see your 5+ years of experience in the industry.
